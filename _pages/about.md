I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington, where I am advised by [Alex Luedtke](https://www.alexluedtke.com/) and [Lalit Jain](https://lalitjain.com/). I am also fortunate to be on the High-Dimensional Structual Theory Team directed by [Masaaki Imaizumi](https://sites.google.com/view/mimaizumi/) at RIKEN/University of Tokyo for Summer 2025. Before coming to UW, I completed my M.S. in electrical and computer engineering at Duke University, advised by [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/home.html), [Sudeepa Roy](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/), and [Alex Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my B.E. in manufacturing processes and automation from the University of Delhi, India, where I was advised by [Umang Soni](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=glxZ4TQAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research centers on machine learning and causal inference. Currently, I'm working on conditional distributional treatment effects, and on adaptive design of instrumental variables.
